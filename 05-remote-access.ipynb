    "# Remote System Access\n",
    "\n",
    "During this course we have been working remotely on an SCRTP managed computer.\n",
    "You will likely have logged into this using ssh or a remote desktop protocol (RDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ssh`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the program that allows you to connect to remote machines. \n",
    "SSH is a protocol that uses public private keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can use SSH and then the agent prompts for password to authenticate and the keys are generated automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or you can set up public private key-pairs, this is how you have set up with SCRTP, you create locally (your computer) a public-private key pair.\n",
    "The public key is put on the remote by an admin, a file transfer, or web frontend.\n",
    "The ssh-agent checks your private key against the public key on the server, for additional security you can password protect your ssh key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSH guide\n",
    "I tend to follow the [GitHub SSH keygen guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\n",
    "And the followup [Add key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account#adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-account)\n",
    "\n",
    "For even more in depth try the [linux handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/ssh/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSH quick reference\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things you can fall back on. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `ssh-keygen`\n",
    "\n",
    "This program can create ssh key pairs for you. Use the man page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Move your key to godzilla\n",
    "\n",
    "On the remote (godzilla), we need to create a list of keys (public) that are authorized to access this account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log in to godzilla and navigate to `~/.ssh` file, creating it if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to check if you already have a list of authorized keys do `ls` and look for `authorized_keys` (`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create this file if it does not exist, and apply the correct file permissions `chmod 600 authorized_keys`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add the content of your public key to the `authorized_keys` file (one key per line).\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Getting public key content\n",
    ">\n",
    "> On local\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `scp .ssh/<keyfile>.pub <user>@godzilla.csc.warwick.ac.uk:~/.ssh/`\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> On Godzilla (`ssh godzilla`)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `cat ~/.ssh/<keyfile.pub> >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> `rm ~/.ssh/<keyfile.pub>`\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### `ssh-copy-id`\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Don't use this on Godzilla as it will lock you out.\n",
    "> `ssh-copy-id` launches multiple ssh connections in quick succession and this triggers the autoban.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> However, on most remotes this program can help with passing your key to the remote negating the need to do the above.\n",
    "> Use the man page for more information.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `~/.ssh`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the default location for ssh files e.g. key pairs, configs and known hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `scp`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Secured CoPy command. Use man for all the options. For an in-depth guide see the [linux handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/scp-command/)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very similar to the `cp` command from earlier, however, it can access remote systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "First lets look at a 'remote file path':\n",
    "\n",
    "In general a remote file path is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<user>@<server>:<path>`\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter half `<path>` is the same as `cp`.\n",
    "However, you should consider where you are accessing e.g. a `/` following the colon will start at the root of the directory, a `~` following it will start at `<user>`'s home.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<user>` is the username for the remote server, you can leave it out if the remote username is the same as your username. \n",
    "\n",
    "`<server>` is the name we give to the remote computer. \n",
    "Sometimes this will be a `hostname` that on your local network will be `resolved`.\n",
    "It can always be an ip address in fact when a hostname is `resolved` its resolved to an ip address.\n",
    "\n",
    "To move a file from a to b then you use:\n",
    "\n",
    "`scp <a: remote file path> <b: remote file path>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing these paths with remote file paths (or local paths) moves file a to b, it can also do recursive copying like we saw with `cp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `rsync`\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote Sync or Rsync is another way to copy from one location to another.\n",
    "Rsync has one advantage, it only copies the files that have changed guaranteeing a shorter copy time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find more details about rsync in the [linux handbook](https://linuxhandbook.com/rsync-command-examples/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `wget`\n",
    "\n",
    "`wget` is a fantastic tool for pulling files from the internet and extremely simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget <URL>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need is the URL of the file you want to download and as always you can look at the man page to get more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thats it for the basic tools for working remotely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of this will be automated in the next section."
