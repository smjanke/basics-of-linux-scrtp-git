    "# How to get software on the SCRTP system\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation page - [Accessing and installing software](https://docs.scrtp.warwick.ac.uk/general-pages/software.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing environments is the name we give to a collection of known software that we will use together to run some code or software program.\n",
    "An environment will not use all the software on the machine, in fact there is a good chance you will have multiple versions of the same software on one machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an environment you need to isolate which programs and software you need.\n",
    "To do this we will manipulate the available paths.\n",
    "We discussed your PATH; it's a list of directories for the computer to search for programs.\n",
    "There are other paths, for example: PYTHONPATH being a good example for python environment creation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> ### Thought Experiment\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> If you are not using an environment then you likely don't know what programs could be being used.\n",
    ">> However, thinking about versions really highlights how things can go wrong.\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> Consider two packages A and B where B has A as a dependency.\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> #### Without environments\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> You have two projects 1 and 2.\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> You use A(V1) to generate a result for project 1.\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> For project 2 you install B to your computer.\n",
    ">> B however requires a newer version of A(V2) so updates it.\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> During a review you need to recreate a result from project 1, however, as A has been updated to V2 by B the result is different because of some change made between A(V1) and A(V2).\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> #### With environments\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> You have two projects 1 and 2.\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> You create a blank environment for project 1 and install A(V1) in it.\n",
    ">> A result is created in this environment for project 1.\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> You start a new project 2, creating a new blank environment for it.\n",
    ">> In this environment you install B. It looks for A but as the environment is blank it can't find it and installs A(V2) which is its dependency.\n",
    ">> You create a result for project 2.\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> During a review you need to recreate a result from project 1. \n",
    ">> Using the environment you created for project 1 you can recreate the result using A(V1) which has not been changed.\n",
    ">> \n",
    ">> #### Conclusions\n",
    ">>\n",
    ">> This is example is slightly reductive and the results are usually more subtle.\n",
    ">> But it should highlight how things can go wrong, most python environments have tens os packages which can all have complicated inter-dependencies on each other.\n",
    ">> Package/environment managers have been built to manage this so we should use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "On the SCRTP systems we use the modules package.\n",
    "Modules allows you to create an environment that contains all the software you need without the software you don't.\n",
    "We have installed (or will install) the software you need and in many cases we install many many versions of common software. \n",
    "Lets see what we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module avail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or to search for something\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module spider python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules is going to edit your environment path(s) by editing your paths we can point it to the correct version using your path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try and load Python for you to use, as opposed to system Python in `/usr/bin/`.\n",
    "> Don't use the python in /usr/bin/python. This is the system python that the system uses and it does not have the ability to be extended with packages or used with other modules in the way you will want to use it!\n",
    "> The system python may also be updated or modified during system maintenance\n",
    "> You can tell which python is loaded using `which python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "module load Python/3.11.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "However this throws an error as Python has dependencies.\n",
    "Furthermore different versions of Python will have different dependencies.\n",
    "We can use module spider again to query this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module spider Python/3.11.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module spider Python/3.9.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For 3.11.5 we need GCCcore/13.2.0 loaded and for 3.9.6 we need GCCcore/11.2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "So to load Python/3.11.5 we run\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load GCCcore/13.2.0 Python/3.11.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now we have Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "which python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can see all the modules we have loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now while you can put modules to load in your .bash_profile this isn't recommended.\n",
    "You should instead simplify loading and unloading using the module collections feature.\n",
    "To save this python setup for use later we can create a collection using `module save`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module save py3_11_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then next time you log onto the system you can quickly run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module restore py3_11_env\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Now let's talk about building on-top of modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules system is the way you should bring in programs that need to have been specifically compiled to run on the hardware. \n",
    "For example BLAS, however some language packages will use these as system dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "> Upfront, if you can avoid it don't use Conda/Miniconda as it plays much less nicely with building clean environments, if you _have_ to use it then do not use any modules provided Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps you should follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load all your module dependencies using `module` load ensure compatibility.\n",
    "2. Create a collection using `module save module_<env_name>`, you can name it however you like.\n",
    "3. Create a Python environment using `python -m venv <env_name>`, again name it how you like.\n",
    "4. Activate the env, `source <env_name>/bin/activate`\n",
    "5. Install additional dependencies using `pip`, `pip install ____`\n",
    "6. Check all expected libraries are available using `pip list`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> How to Debug: Deactivate env and unload modules, `deactivate` and `module purge`, then restore modules and source env `module restore <name>` and  reactivate env `source <name>/bin/activate`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Note: Do not load modules in the pip environment, if a new system module is desired the python env must be recreated from scratch.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra considerations, some python packages such as PyTorch have been specifically compiled to be optimized for our hardware.\n",
    "Additionally, some bundles are provided for a quick `one and done` software stack in Python.\n",
    "If you want to use these then you load them before creating your python environment.\n",
    "Finally if a Python package, when installed by pip, has a system dependency that can be provided by modules this is advisable."
