    "# Automating and configuring your shell\n",
    "\n",
    "You likely already know how powerful the linux command line can be. But you likely also have some fustration around some repetition of commands, logins etc.\n",
    "In this section we will look at some automation and configuration tips you can and should use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shell configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "In, very, brief there are a collection of configuration files for the shell here, specifically bash, that add items in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First up we need to understand the difference between an interactive and non interactive shell.\n",
    "The former is the type of shell we have been using to run commands directly.\n",
    "The latter is the type you get if you run `bash myscript.sh` or `./myscript.sh` when it includes a shebang pointing it to `bash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to consider a login vs. non-login shell.\n",
    "When bash is launched into locally or via ssh it executes a login shell, this can also be forced using a --login option.\n",
    "If a new shell is created using a login shell (or a new tab in desktop linux) then unless specified it will be a non-login shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple places to put shell configuration and some rules around what goes where.\n",
    "The interactive bash shell has the following rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If a login shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. bash looks for `/etc/profile` and runs the commands in this file.\n",
    "2. bash looks in the home directory `~/` for `.bash_profile`, `.bash_login`, then `.profile`. It executes the commands in the first file found in the order listed, other files are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If a non-login shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash looks for and executes commands found in `.bashrc` if it exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important notes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.bashrc` gets run by other things\n",
    "Often `.bash_profile` (or `.profile` if in a bash shell) will run `.bashrc` so both are run when you login.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `.profile` is for more than just bash\n",
    "While we are talking about bash as it is the default shell on SCRTP linux we must note that other shells exist.\n",
    "`~/.profile` is preferred to  by many linux distributions as it is read by any shell not just bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is any of this important\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly you may want to make aliases lets say every time you launch a terminal you want to be reminded that the SCRTP systems are shared resources and you need to use the queues to run intensive jobs.\n",
    "To do this you could write a shell script and put it in `~/.configuration/` in your home dir:\n",
    "\n",
    "`~/.configuration/reminder.sh`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"it is very important that you remember not to run compute intensive jobs on shared systems\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "chmod that to make it executable\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in `~/.bashrc`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#...stuff before\n",
    "\n",
    "~/.configuration/reminder.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "#...stuff after\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now whenever we run that shell that message appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that if you write useful utilities for jobs you run all the time in shell you may want to add them to the path.\n",
    "You can do this by making sure the folder where you keep them is in the path in the `.bashrc` file.\n",
    "For example say you have `~/scripts/` packed full of useful executable scripts.\n",
    "In `.bashrc`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#...stuff before\n",
    "\n",
    "export PATH=\"$HOME/scripts:$PATH\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#...stuff after\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking that down:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$HOME` is equal to `~/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`$HOME/scripts` is that folder where you store your scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "`$PATH` is the full path\n",
    "\n",
    "`PATH` elements are joined using `:` so having `:$PATH` at the end takes all of the old path and puts the new bit of the path you want in the first position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PATH` is read from front to back so your new folder is searched before anything else.\n",
    "This does mean if you make a script called for example `ssh` then it will be found and run when you use `ssh` and the original `ssh` will be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do I do with this information?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many things:\n",
    "1. It's likely at some point a program will need something in your PATH to run.\n",
    "2. Other programs, Conda, will mess with your .bashrc to mess with your PATH\n",
    "3. If some program or utility or python package or C library e.t.c. cannot be found it could be because it needs to be in the PATH.\n",
    "4. A plethora of other reasons where you will need to debug or understand how this all works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ssh configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "`ssh` configuration is an example of one of the most useful configuration files but understanding that utilities usually have a local configuration file is good to know in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.ssh` folder that exists in your home. `~/.ssh/` can have a file called `config`.\n",
    "If this file exists your system will pick it up and use the information contained within.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The config file \n",
    "\n",
    "In the config file you can make an alias for a given remote that you login to frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example config entry for Godzilla the SCRTP system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "Host godzilla\n",
    "    HostName godzilla.csc.warwick.ac.uk\n",
    "    User <SCRTP username>\n",
    "    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/godzilla_rsa\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of these entries is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Host: name you want for your alias\n",
    "\n",
    "HostName: ip address or hostname \n",
    "\n",
    "User: username on the remote\n",
    "\n",
    "IdentityFile: takes the path to the name of the ssh private key file for the remote system system\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For more entries and their uses use `man ssh_config`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the indentation is for readability not for any purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise, write your own ssh config\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your own ssh config file for godzilla and avon if you have a login.\n",
    "Additionally you can write entries for any other systems you use."
